Create a branch to work in when you work on something. 
Update and commit frequently, not when a feature is complete.
Commit and merge the branch when a feature is ready to be implemented in base.
Stick to the style guide.
Put your Trello task on "Verification" when done, add the verifier to the task and notify that person.
Use of the standard library (and STL) is fully allowed and encouraged, however, if you can make something faster by doing it yourself, do so.
